   <dd>The LG G2 OLED is the best LG TV and the best LG OLED TV we've tested. It's a premium <br>
       TV with a very unique design, as it comes with a no-gap wall mount instead of a stand.<br>
       Combined with its uniform design and thin bezels, it blends into your surrounding environment. <br>
       Additionally, with its Gallery Mode feature, it's designed to look like a piece of art while <br>
       it's not in use as a regular TV. It uses a more advanced OLED panel than most of the other 2022 models<br>
       allowing it to deliver impressive picture quality.</dd><br>

          <p> Like the LG G2 OLED, it's an incredible TV for gamers, with a nearly instantaneous response time<br>
              that delivers crystal-clear motion with no distracting ghosting behind fast-moving objects. <br>
              It supports HDMI 2.1 on all four inputs, meaning you can enjoy fast 4k @ 120Hz gaming from both <br>
              the Xbox Series S|X and PS5 or a recent PC graphics card. It runs the s22 version of LG's webOS smart interface<br>
              which is smooth and easy to use, and there's a great selection of streaming apps available.</p>
